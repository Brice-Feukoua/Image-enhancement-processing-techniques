# Image-enhancement-processing-techniques

Create a function to evaluate the PSNR between two gray images.
Using an original gray image(Lenna), perform & display images from down-sampling technique and up-sampling technique using nearest neighbor.
Calculate the PSNR between the original image (Lenna) and the up-sampled images i.e. , nearest, bilinear, and bicubic, respectively
Use the monochrome image Lenna as input to add Gaussian White noise and Salt & Pepper noise with density 10%; display the obtained images.
Evaluate the PSNR of the previous images with respect to the original image (Lenna).
Display the histograms of all modified images.
Enhance the contrast of an image using the command "histeq" and display the enhanced image.
